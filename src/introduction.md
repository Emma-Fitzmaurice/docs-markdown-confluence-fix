# Markdown to Confluence Tools

Welcome to the `markdown-confluence` project, your one-stop solution to bridging the gap between the simple, intuitive world of Markdown and the robust, versatile realm of Confluence! We know you love the ease and convenience of writing in Markdown, and we're here to make sure you can continue doing just that, without compromising the ability to publish your content on Confluence. With our suite of tools, including an Obsidian plugin, npm CLI, Docker CLI, GitHub Action, and npm library, you can effortlessly convert your Markdown files to Atlassian Document Format (ADF) and seamlessly integrate them with Confluence.

Our project was born out of a desire to simplify the publishing process and create an enjoyable, hassle-free experience for Markdown enthusiasts who also work with Confluence. We believe that the best tools are those that make life easier, not harder. That's why we've crafted an opinionated, streamlined workflow that makes the entire publishing process a breeze, while still allowing for customization and flexibility. Obsidian.md is our recommended editor, but rest assured that our tools can be used with any Markdown files, so you're free to choose the setup that suits you best.

We're eager to build a vibrant community around the `markdown-confluence` project and are excited to have you be a part of this journey. As we work towards cultivating a strong user base, we envision a future where our users not only appreciate the simplicity and efficiency of our tools, but also enjoy sharing ideas, collaborating, and contributing to the project. We invite you to give `markdown-confluence` a try and experience firsthand how it can revolutionize your Markdown-to-Confluence workflow. And remember, we're here to support you every step of the way, making sure your journey into the delightful world of `markdown-confluence` is nothing short of amazing.
